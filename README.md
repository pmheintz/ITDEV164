## About

This repo was added as a way to remotely access my class files for Web Programming 2. 
Additioinally, I wanted to get more fimilar with using git and github. The code in 
this repo is for educational uses only. Code was developed and tested on a _homebrew'd_ 
local host running apache 2.4, php 7.2, and mySQL 5.6.
